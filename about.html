      <h1>Little bit about the author</h1>
      <p>
        I am a junior at Claremont McKenna College studying international
        relations and economics . In my free time I enjoy reading the classics,
        exercising as well as engaging in a lot of activities and clubs on
        campus.

      <h2>Motorcycles for life</h2>
      <p>
        I am very much into motorcycles. I currently own two, one in the States
        and one in Estonia. The one in America is a Kawasaki KLR650, which is
        tall standing adventure bike made to cover long distances with a very
        smooth torque output for crossing difficult terrain. The high clearance
        from the ground also contirbutes to the ease of riding in rocky terrain
        as well as allows for a very ergonomic riding stance.

        The bike is made mostly for commuting as it puts out only 37Kw of power.
        However, you can also take it to the high way and hit close to 150 km/h
        with ease. The Moto Guzzi was my very first motorcycle and the buying
        process was something as follows. I entered the store
