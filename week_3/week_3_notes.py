This file contains Wednesday's lecture notes.
================================================================================
Labs/quizzes are entered into sakai.
- Quiz average: 8.5  (up from 7.0 last week!)
  - 6 students with score <= 5
  - if that's you, re-evaluate your study techniques
  - all material is fair game for future quizzes
- Lab:
  - most students got 5/5
  - 7 students received a 0/5; common problems include
    - no submission
    - submitting the lab.py file instead of the doctests
    - not submitting the entire doctest output
      (often caused by an infinite loop in the num_digits function)
  - if you received a 0, please resubmit
    I will waive the late penalty for this lab
- Current overall average grade: 88.3
================================================================================
As a reminder, we've now seen 4 ways to run python:
    1. pythontutor.com
    2. $ python3 filename.py            # the "triangle button"
    3. $ python3 -m doctest filename.py # runs the doctests
    4. $ python3                        # runs "interactive python"
In order for python to be able to find your files,
you need to have the right folder open.
For some people, this means pressing the "pages button" in the left of vscode and then pressing "open folder".
For other people, this means running a command like
    $ cd foldername
in the terminal to "change directory" into the folder that contains your python files.
Today, we will see a 5th way to run python:
    5. $ python3 -i filename.py
The -i stands for interactive, and this is a special way to run interactive python that also loads the file and gives you access to all its internal functions and variables.

    There are three ways to solve this problem:
